# Handwritten_digits: a simple project to predict handwritten digits.

**Dataset** https://www.kaggle.com/ombais/mnist-fashion-data-classification 
The dataset contains a database of handwritten digits. It is made up a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. The goal is to train models with SVM and Neural Network to understand the patterns in the pixels of each digit in the dataset.


Tasks accomplished:

1. Data Visualization
2. PCA for dimensionality reduction.
2. Linear SVM to predict digits.
3. Simple CNN to predict digits.
